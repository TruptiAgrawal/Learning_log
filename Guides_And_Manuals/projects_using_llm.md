Our mistakes: 
------------
1. We believed that there would only be one "nice" version and stuck on to "solving" that one version repeatedly though starting to fail after a singificant point.
2. Spent lots of time trying to get things done "rightly" instead of exploring various approaches for the same problem statatment. 
3. Lacked proper documentation of major achievements or design for the project
4. No proper step by step execution.
5. Gave big documents in the name of "requriements.txt" 

Learning: 
--------
1. Make multiple versions for the project and ⁠commit after each significant checkpoint is achievend. 
2. ⁠Compare them and take the best of the versions and make a new version. 
3. Ask for summaries after a significant work to make sure the llm is following throughly. 
4. Properly document all the specifications of the system to act as a template that can be used as base to create multiple versions. 
5. Take the best of the versions and move ahead constructively.
6. Think critical and get down to the roots of backend or workflow to make sure the process is clean.
7. give simple points and construct a specifications document from it and NOT jump right into the ocean. 

Note: 
----
Key factor here remains the way the process is documented : which can clearly help the user to understand the workflow of the project.
