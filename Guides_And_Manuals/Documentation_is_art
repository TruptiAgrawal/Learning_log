==========================================================================================================
-- if good documentation “is a love letter you write to your future self” (Damian Conway),
   then no documentation is a trap you set for your future self.

-- Because writing good documentation, no matter how lean and mean, can go a long way in:
    Increasing productivity
    Cutting down on wasteful meetings
    Fostering understanding
    Facilitating quick onboarding and training
    Future-proofing changes in an organization

-- The documentation tells us what we did, how we did it, and why we did it that way.

-- Documentation helps us:
    1. Remember what we did - it’s easy to forget the details of how we got to where we are today. 
    2. Communicate with others. Documenting our work forces us to articulate our thoughts in a way that others can 
    easily understand. 
    3. Improve our work. 

-- Start small
    Don’t boil the ocean. Start with a discrete slice of a project, product, or process to kick off the effort. 
    Then, build as you go along. Don’t get overwhelmed by the size and scope of the task.
    And most importantly, get started today. Don’t wait for the perfect moment or the perfect solution. 
    There is no such thing. Documentation is never done. It’s always a work in progress.
    The goal is to make it better, not perfect.
