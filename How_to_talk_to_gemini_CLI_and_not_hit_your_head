GEMINI CLI TIPS:
* Clearly state what you want, who it’s for, and any limits (time, length, style).
* Mention the format you expect — list, paragraph, table, or code.
* Give one good example of the style you like, and one you don’t.
* Ask for a plan first, then the final answer — this helps catch mistakes early.
* Tell it what to do if something’s unclear — ask questions or make assumptions.
* Specify the tone — formal, casual, friendly, etc.
* If you need facts, ask for sources or dates.
* When giving long text, separate sections clearly so it’s easier to follow.
* For edits, say exactly which part to change instead of “rewrite everything.”
* If your tool allows it, adjust creativity or detail level.
* Ask for extra options or edge cases to cover all possibilities.
* End with a short summary and next steps.
* Save prompts that work well so you can reuse them.
* Think through your request before sending — the LLM can’t read your mind.

Error solving in CLI:
* Write down the exact error 
* make a short concise prompt to address the root of error if possbile 

Key notes:
* Document the major instructions, summaries, critiques and improvements suggested. 
* Make sure to store you output after every significant change if you do not want to loose your progress. 
* make a log of what you learnt.
* Make sure to run gemini cli multiple times instead of a single strech 

Summary:
Gemini CLI is dumb. shift to something else if possible.
